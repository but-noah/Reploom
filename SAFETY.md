## No Auto-Send Policy

**Reploom never automatically sends emails on behalf of users.**

### Human-in-the-Loop Workflow
- All AI-generated drafts require explicit human review and approval
- Drafts are created in Gmail's "Drafts" folder and remain there until manually sent
- Users can:
  - **Approve**: Mark draft as ready to send (user must still manually send from Gmail)
  - **Reject**: Discard the draft
  - **Request Edit**: Provide feedback for regeneration (future feature)

### Why Draft-Only Mode?
1. **Safety**: Prevents accidental or inappropriate automated emails
2. **Quality Control**: Humans verify accuracy, tone, and appropriateness
3. **Compliance**: Meets requirements for human oversight in sensitive communications
4. **Trust**: Users maintain full control over what gets sent

### Confidence Gates
- Each draft includes a confidence score (0.0-1.0) from the classifier
- Workspaces can set `approval_threshold` for flagging low-confidence drafts
- Low-confidence drafts are highlighted in the review UI
- **Note**: Even high-confidence drafts require human approval

## Gmail Scopes & Permissions

Reploom requests minimal Gmail API scopes necessary for core functionality.

### Required Scopes

| Scope | Purpose | Why We Need It |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `openid` | Basic authentication | Standard OAuth 2.0 requirement |
| `profile` | User profile information | Display user name in UI |
| `email` | User email address | Identify the connected Gmail account |
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly` | Read emails and labels | Fetch thread context for draft generation |
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify` | Modify drafts and labels | Create and update drafts in Gmail |
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.compose` | Create new messages | Generate draft replies |

### What We DON'T Request
- ‚ùå `gmail.send` - We cannot send emails on your behalf
- ‚ùå `gmail.settings.basic` - We cannot modify Gmail settings
- ‚ùå `gmail.settings.sharing` - We cannot change forwarding rules
- ‚ùå Full drive access - We only access Gmail

### Scope Limitations
- **Read-only thread access**: We fetch message content only when generating drafts
- **Draft modification only**: We create/update drafts but cannot send them
- **No permanent deletion**: We don't delete emails, only work with drafts

### Revoking Access
Users can revoke Reploom's Gmail access at any time:
1. Visit Google Account Settings: https://myaccount.google.com/permissions
2. Find "Reploom" or your Auth0 application
3. Click "Remove Access"

## Data Residency & Storage

### What Data We Store

| Data Type | Location | Retention | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Draft reviews | PostgreSQL (your instance) | Indefinite (user-controlled) | Track review workflow and analytics |
| Original message excerpts | PostgreSQL | Indefinite (user-controlled) | Provide context in review UI |
| AI-generated drafts | PostgreSQL + Gmail Drafts | Until approved/rejected | Allow review and editing |
| Workspace settings | PostgreSQL | Indefinite | Store tone level, blocklist, style preferences |
| User metadata | PostgreSQL | While account active | Link reviews to users |
| Uploaded documents | PostgreSQL + Qdrant | Until deleted | RAG context for draft generation |
| Document embeddings | Qdrant vector DB | Until document deleted | Semantic search for KB retrieval |

### What Data We DON'T Store
- ‚ùå Full email content (only excerpts needed for context)
- ‚ùå Gmail refresh tokens (using Auth0 Token Vault)
- ‚ùå Raw OAuth access tokens in application database
- ‚ùå Email attachments (unless explicitly uploaded as documents)
- ‚ùå Complete Gmail mailbox archives

### Data Residency Configuration

**Current Status**: üöß Placeholder - Not yet implemented

**Future Implementation**:
```python
# Environment variable to control data residency
DATA_RESIDENCY_REGION = "us-east-1"  # Options: us-east-1, eu-west-1, ap-southeast-2

# Database endpoint configuration
POSTGRES_HOST = f"reploom-db-{DATA_RESIDENCY_REGION}.example.com"
QDRANT_HOST = f"reploom-vector-{DATA_RESIDENCY_REGION}.example.com"

# Compliance mode flags
GDPR_MODE = True  # Enable GDPR-compliant data handling
CCPA_MODE = True  # Enable CCPA-compliant data handling
DATA_RETENTION_DAYS = 90  # Auto-delete old reviews after N days
```

**Planned Features**:
- Regional database deployment options
- Automatic data retention policies
- User-initiated data export (GDPR Article 20)
- User-initiated data deletion (GDPR Article 17 - Right to be forgotten)

**For Enterprise Deployments**:
- Self-hosted option: Deploy Reploom entirely in your infrastructure
- No data leaves your environment
- Full control over data residency and retention
- Bring your own databases (PostgreSQL, Qdrant)

## Security Features

### 1. Auth0 Token Vault
**Problem**: Storing OAuth refresh tokens is risky and complicates compliance.

**Solution**: Auth0 Token Vault provides credential-free API access.

**How it works**:
```
User ‚Üí Auth0 Login ‚Üí Token Vault stores refresh token
‚Üì
Reploom Backend needs Gmail access
‚Üì
Auth0 Token Vault exchanges federated token for access token
‚Üì
Reploom uses access token (short-lived, never stored)
```

**Benefits**:
- No refresh tokens in application database
- Short-lived access tokens (1 hour expiry)
- Automatic token rotation
- Revocation via Auth0 dashboard
- Audit logs for all token exchanges

### 2. PII Redaction in Logs
All logs automatically redact sensitive information:

```python
# User IDs truncated
"auth0|1234567890abcdef" ‚Üí "auth0|123..."

# Email addresses masked
"user@example.com" ‚Üí "***@***"

# Draft content not logged
# Only metadata (thread_id, run_id, confidence) appears in logs
```

### 3. OpenTelemetry Observability
Distributed tracing tracks all operations without exposing sensitive data:

**Traced operations**:
- Gmail API calls (without email content)
- Agent workflow execution
- Database queries (parameterized, no data in logs)
- API endpoint requests (user IDs redacted)

**Security context attributes**:
- `user.id`: Redacted user identifier
- `workspace.id`: Workspace identifier
- `operation.type`: Operation category (classify, draft, retrieve)
- `auth.method`: Authentication method used

**NOT traced**:
- Email message bodies
- Draft HTML content
- User passwords or tokens
- PII from uploaded documents

### 4. Fine-Grained Authorization (Auth0 FGA)
Every operation checks user permissions:

```
User ‚Üí API Request ‚Üí Auth0 FGA checks:
  - Can user access this workspace?
  - Can user read this draft?
  - Can user modify workspace settings?
  - Can user upload documents to this workspace?
```

**Permission model**:
- `workspace:admin` - Full workspace control
- `workspace:member` - Create and review drafts
- `workspace:viewer` - Read-only access
- `document:owner` - Created the document
- `document:shared` - Document shared with user

### 5. Database Security
- Passwords stored with bcrypt hashing
- Parameterized queries (SQLModel ORM prevents SQL injection)
- Database connection over TLS (production)
- Row-level security (future enhancement)

## Privacy & PII Handling

### What Qualifies as PII?
- Email addresses
- User names
- Phone numbers
- Physical addresses
- Credit card numbers
- Social Security Numbers
- Any government-issued IDs

### How We Protect PII

#### 1. Minimize Collection
- Only extract message excerpts (first 500 characters) for context
- Don't store full email threads
- Don't store email metadata (headers, sender details beyond what's needed)

#### 2. Access Controls
- Users can only see their own drafts (unless shared via workspace)
- Workspace isolation prevents cross-workspace data access
- API endpoints filter by `user_id` automatically

#### 3. Redaction in Logs
- Automatic PII redaction in application logs
- OpenTelemetry traces exclude sensitive attributes
- Error messages don't expose data (only generic errors to users)

#### 4. Document Sharing Controls
- Documents default to private (only uploader can access)
- Explicit sharing required to grant access
- Sharing scoped to workspace members
- Document deletion cascades to embeddings

#### 5. Data Export & Deletion
**Current**: Manual via database queries

**Future**: Self-service via UI
- Export all my data (JSON format)
- Delete my account and all associated data
- Download all draft reviews and settings
