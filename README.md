# Assistant0: An AI Personal Assistant Secured with Auth0 - LangGraph Python/FastAPI Version

Assistant0 an AI personal assistant that consolidates your digital life by dynamically accessing multiple tools to help you stay organized and efficient.

## About the template

This template scaffolds an Auth0 + LangChain.js + Next.js starter app. It mainly uses the following libraries:

- [LangChain's Python framework](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) and [LangGraph.js](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) for building agentic workflows.
- The [Auth0 AI SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-ai-python) and [Auth0 FastAPI SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-fastapi) to secure the application and call third-party APIs.
- [Auth0 FGA](https://auth0.com/fine-grained-authorization) to define fine-grained access control policies for your tools and RAG pipelines.

## Features

Here's some of the features that are implemented:

1. **Gmail Integration:** The assistant can scan your inbox to generate concise summaries. It can highlight urgent emails, categorizes conversations by importance, and even suggest drafts for quick replies.
2. **Calendar Management:** By interfacing with your calendar, it can remind you of upcoming meetings, check for scheduling conflicts, and even propose the best time slots for new appointments based on your availability.
3. **User Information Retrieval:** The assistant can retrieve information about the user from their authentication profile, including their name, email, and other relevant details.
4. **Online Shopping with Human-in-the-Loop Authorizations:** The assistant can make purchases on your behalf (using a fake API for demo purposes), with the ability to ask for human confirmation before finalizing transactions.
5. **Document Upload and Retrieval:** The assistant can upload PDF and text documents to the database and retrieve them for context during chat. The docs can be shared with other users.
6. **Slack Notifications [coming soon]:** For team communications, the assistant can monitor Slack channels. It identifies key messages and creates action items, ensuring you never miss an important update from your colleagues.
7. **Google Drive Access [coming soon]:** Whether you need immediate access to the latest project document or a file related to a current task, the assistant retrieves pertinent documents from Google Drive on demand. It can create document summaries and even create documents based on your instructions.

With tool-calling capabilities, the possibilities are endless. In this conceptual scenario, the AI agent embodies a digital personal secretaryâ€”one that not only processes information but also proactively collates data from connected services to provide comprehensive task management. This level of integration not only enhances efficiency but also ushers in a new era of intelligent automation, where digital assistants serve as reliable, all-in-one solutions that tailor themselves to your personal and professional needs.

## Security Challenges with Tool Calling AI Agents

Building such an assistant is not too difficult. Thanks to frameworks like [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/), and [Vercel AI](https://vercel.com/ai), you can get started quickly. The difficult part is doing it securely so that you can protect the user's data and credentials.

Many current solutions involve storing credentials and secrets in the AI agent application's environment or letting the agent impersonate the user. This is not a good idea, as it can lead to security vulnerabilities and excessive scope and access for the AI agent.

## Tool Calling with the Help of Auth0

This is where Auth0 comes to the rescue. As the leading identity provider (IdP) for modern applications, our upcoming product, [Auth for GenAI](https://a0.to/ai-content), provides standardized ways built on top of OAuth and OpenID Connect to call APIs of tools on behalf of the end user from your AI agent.

Auth0's [Token Vault](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/token-vault) feature helps broker a secure and controlled handshake between the AI agents and the services you want the agent to interact with on your behalf â€“ in the form of scoped access tokens. This way, the agent and LLM do not have access to the credentials and can only call the tools with the permissions you have defined in Auth0. This also means your AI agent only needs to talk to Auth0 for authentication and not the tools directly, making integrations easier.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

First, clone this repo and download it locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-assistant0.git
cd auth0-assistant0
```

The project is divided into two parts:

- `backend/` contains the backend code for the Web app and API written in Python using FastAPI.
- `frontend/` contains the frontend code for the Web app written in React as a Vite SPA.

### Setup the backend

```bash
cd backend
```

Next, you'll need to set up environment variables in your repo's `.env` file. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`.

To start with the basic examples, you'll just need to add your OpenAI API key and Auth0 credentials.

- To start with the examples, you'll just need to add your OpenAI API key and Auth0 credentials for the Web app.
  - You can setup a new Auth0 tenant with an Auth0 Web App and Token Vault following the Prerequisites instructions [here](https://auth0.com/ai/docs/call-others-apis-on-users-behalf).
  - An Auth0 FGA account, you can create one [here](https://dashboard.fga.dev). Add the FGA store ID, client ID, client secret, and API URL to the `.env` file.

Next, install the required packages using your preferred package manager, e.g. uv:

```bash
uv sync
```

Now you're ready to start the database:

```bash
# start the postgres database
docker compose up -d
```

Initialize FGA store:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m app.core.fga_init
```

Now you're ready to run the development server:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
fastapi dev app/main.py
```

### Start the LangGraph server

Next, you'll need to start an in-memory LangGraph server on port 54367, to do so open a new terminal and run:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -U langgraph-api
langgraph dev --port 54367 --allow-blocking
```

### Start the frontend server

Rename `.env.example` file to `.env` in the `frontend` directory.

Finally, you can start the frontend server in another terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env # Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
npm install # or bun install
npm run dev # or bun run dev
```

This will start a React vite server on port 5173.

Agent configuration lives in `backend/app/agents/assistant0.ts`. From here, you can change the prompt and model, or add other tools and logic.
